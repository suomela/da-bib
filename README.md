# da.bib

Bibliography entries related to distributed graph algorithms, LOCAL model, quantum-LOCAL model, LCL problems, etc.

File [da.bib](da.bib) should be ready to use in your LaTeX documents. All entries should have consistent human-readable BibTeX keys. All entries have DOIs, with the exception of those explicitly marked with `_nodoi`.

File [da.tex](da.tex) contains some commonly-used references (e.g. for definitions of various models of distributed computing), so you can more easily copy-paste the relevant references from there.
